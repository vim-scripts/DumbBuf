My .vimrc:
  let dumbbuf_hotkey = '<Leader>b'
  " sometimes I put <Esc> to close dumbbuf buffer,
  " which was mapped to close QuickBuf's list :)
  let dumbbuf_mappings = {
      &#039n': {
          &#039<Esc>': {'alias_to': 'q'},
      \}
  \}

  let dumbbuf_wrap_cursor = 0
  let dumbbuf_remove_marked_when_close = 1


Mappings:
  please define g:dumbbuf_hotkey at first.
  if that is not defined, this script is not loaded.

  Visual Mode:
      x
          mark buffers on selected region.
          see Normal Mode's xx for details.

  Normal Mode:
      q
          :close dumbbuf buffer.
      g:dumbbuf_hotkey
          toggle dumbbuf buffer.
      <CR>
          :edit buffer.
      u
         open one by one. this is same as QuickBuf's u.
      s
         :split buffer.
      v
         :vspilt buffer.
      t
         :tabedit buffer.
      d
         :bdelete buffer.
      w
         :bwipeout buffer.
      l
         toggle listed buffers or unlisted buffers.
      c
         :close buffer.
      x
          mark buffer.
          if one or more marked buffers exist,
          's', 'v', 't', 'd', 'w', 'c'
          get to be able to execute for that buffers at a time.

  and, if you turn on 'g:dumbbuf_single_key',
  you can use single key mappings like QuickBuf.vim.
  see 'g:dumbbuf_single_key' at 'Global Variables' for details.


Global Variables:
  g:dumbbuf_hotkey (default: no default value)
      a mapping which calls dumbbuf buffer.
      if this variable is not defined, this plugin will be not loaded.

  g:dumbbuf_open_with (default: 'botright')
      open dumbbuf buffer with this command.

  g:dumbbuf_vertical (default: 0)
      if true, open dumbbuf buffer vertically.

  g:dumbbuf_buffer_height (default: 10)
      dumbbuf buffer's height.
      this is used when only g:dumbbuf_vertical is false.

  g:dumbbuf_buffer_width (default: 25)
      dumbbuf buffer's width.
      this is used when only g:dumbbuf_vertical is true.

  g:dumbbuf_listed_buffer_name (default: '__buffers__')
      dumbbuf buffer's filename.
      set this filename when showing 'listed buffers'.
      'listed buffers' are opposite of 'unlisted-buffers'.
      see ':help unlisted-buffer'.

      NOTE: DON'T assign string which includes whitespace, or any special
      characters like "*", "?", ",".
      see :help file-pattern

  g:dumbbuf_unlisted_buffer_name (default: '__unlisted_buffers__')
      dumbbuf buffer's filename.
      set this filename when showing 'unlisted buffers'.

      NOTE: DON'T assign string which includes whitespace, or any special
      characters like "*", "?", ",".
      see :help file-pattern

  g:dumbbuf_cursor_pos (default: 'current')
      jumps to this position when dumbbuf buffer opens.
      this is useful for deleting some buffers continuaslly.

      'current':
          jump to the current buffer's line.
      'keep':
          keep the cursor pos.
      'top':
          always jump to the top line.
      'bottom':
          always jump to the bottom line

  g:dumbbuf_shown_type (default: '')
      show this type of buffers list.

      '':
          if current buffer is unlisted, show unlisted buffers list.
          if current buffer is listed, show listed buffers list.
      'unlisted':
          show always unlisted buffers list.
      'listed':
          show always listed buffers list.
      'project':
          show buffers each project.

  g:dumbbuf_close_when_exec (default: 0)
      if true, close when execute local mapping from dumbbuf buffer.

  g:dumbbuf_remove_marked_when_close (default: 0)
      remove all marked buffers on closing dumbbuf buffer.
      this default value is for only backward compatibility.
      (if I could fix this variable name...
       'dumbbuf_close_when_exec' => 'dumbbuf_close_on_exec')

  g:dumbbuf_downward (default: 1)
      if true, go downwardly when 'u' mapping.
      if false, go upwardly.

  g:dumbbuf_hl_cursorline (default: "guibg=Red  guifg=White")
      local value of highlight 'CursorLine' in dumbbuf buffer.

  g:dumbbuf_wrap_cursor (default: 1)
      wrap the cursor at the top or bottom of dumbbuf buffer.

  g:dumbbuf_all_shown_types (default: ['listed', 'unlisted', 'project'])
      all available shown types.

  g:dumbbuf_timeoutlen (default: 0)
      local value of &timeoutlen in dumbbuf buffer.


  For The Experienced User:
      g:dumbbuf_disp_expr (default: see the definition)
          this variable is for the experienced users.

          'v:val' has buffer's info.
          NOTE: 'val' does NOT work now.

      g:dumbbuf_options (default: see the definition)
          this variable is for the experienced users.
          dumbbuf buffer will be set up with these options.

      g:dumbbuf_mappings (default: see the definition)
          this variable is for the experienced users.
          these settings will override default value.

          if your .vimrc setting is

            let g:dumbbuf_mappings = {
                &#039n': {
                    &#039<Esc>': {'alias_to': 'q'}
                \}
            \}

          you can type <Esc> to close dumbbuf buffer.
          no influences for other default mappings.

          and there are some special keys:
              'alias_to': 'map'
                  make an alias for 'map'.
              'swap_with': 'map'
